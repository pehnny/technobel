MISSING NUMBER
Pattern: Math (sum formula) or Set

Given a list containing n distinct numbers taken from the range
0, 1, 2, ..., n (so exactly one number in that range is missing),
return the missing number.

Examples:
    missing_number([3, 0, 1])       -> 2
    missing_number([0, 1])          -> 2
    missing_number([9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]) -> 8

Think about: the numbers 0..n have a known total (n * (n + 1) // 2).
If you compare that to the actual sum of the list, what does the
difference tell you? A Set-based approach also works.
